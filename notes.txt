"One of these cells will be empty, the others will contain numbers, starting
from 1, **that will be unique in this instance of the puzzle**."
Does that mean the numbers don't have to be [1, 2, 3, 4, ...N]?
As in they could be [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, ...N].
We should have a snarky message for this case.

We should also have a snarky message for when there are multiple of a number.
